# Introducción a la programación en C++

Lista de ejemplos básicos:

1. [example_01.cpp](../examples/01_intro/01/example_01.cpp) Simple program that prints a line of text 
	- The ```main``` Function, Is a part of every C++ program. The parentheses after main indicate that main is a program building block called a function. C++ programs typically consist of one or more functions and classes.  Exactly one function in every program must be named main.
	- The ```std``` Namespace, the std:: before cout is required when we use names that we’ve brought into the program by the preprocessing directive #include <iostream>. The notation std::cout specifies that we are using a name, in this case cout, that belongs to namespace std.
	- Escape sequences](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/escape), special characters within string literals and character literals
	- The ```return``` statement, is one of several means we’ll use to exit a function. When the return statement is used at the end of main, as shown here, the value 0 indicates that the program has terminated successfully.
[example_02.cpp]((../examples/02_intro/02/example_02.cpp)) Printing a line of text with multiple statements
1. [example_03.cpp]((../examples/03_intro/03/example_03.cpp)) Working with Integers
    - [Types](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/types)
    - [Arithmetic operators](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_arithmetic)
1. [example_04.cpp]((../examples/04_intro/04/example_04.cpp)) Operators
