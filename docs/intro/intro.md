## Introduction to C++ Programming, Input/Output and Operators
1. ```example_01.cpp``` Simple program that prints a line of text    
    - The ```main``` Function
        
        Is a part of every C++ program. The parentheses after main indicate that main is a
     program building block called a function. C++ programs typically consist of one or more functions and classes. 
     Exactly one function in every program must be named main.
    
   - The ```std``` Namespace

        The std:: before cout is required when we use names that we’ve brought into the program by the preprocessing 
        directive #include <iostream>. The notation std::cout specifies that we are using a name, in this case cout, 
        that belongs to namespace std. 
        
    - [Escape sequences](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/escape) 
    
        Special characters within string literals and character literals
        
    - The ```return``` statement
        
        Is one of several means we’ll use to exit a function. When the return statement is used at the end of main, as
     shown here, the value 0 indicates that the program has terminated successfully.
